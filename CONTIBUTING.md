# Contribution Guide

PRs, comments, issues are more than welcome. Please do contribute.

Particularly in demand are people who can improve cross-platform support - particularly for Windows, which I loathe.

# Contribution principles

In order of importance:

1. Does it work?

2. Is it elegant, using accepted idioms, no early pessimisation?

3. Did you use spaces rather than tabs?

4. Did I avoid re-styling code that I didn't change? (This makes tracking diffs impossible)

5. Is is readable?

6. Did you star my repo?

Other than that there is no style guide. C++ is a free-form language. Let's keep it that way.

Extra points awarded for elegant, clever and succinct use of c++ language features.
